# welcome to goofy ahh mod
you need [minecraft forge for 1.20.1](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.20.1.html) please use the 47.3.0 before submitting issues<br>
find this mod on the [releases page](https://github.com/gonna-give-you-u/goofy-ahh-mod/releases)<br><br>

if you dont know how to install mods here's how:<br>
1. install forge (close the launcher first)
2. reopen the launcher (and select the forge profile if it's not already selected)
3. launch the game and let it load i think
4. close the game
5. (optional but recommended) go to the installations tab, click on the forge (not play), expand "MORE OPTIONS", change the 2 in -Xmx2G to the amount of gigabytes of RAM you want to let minecraft use
6. put this mod jar (find it in Releases) into the mods directory (folder)<br>
   winbloat: %appdata%\\.minecraft\mods ( C:\Users\your-username\AppData\Roaming\\.minecraft\mods )<br>
   linux: \~/.minecraft/mods ( /home/your-username/.minecraft/mods) (if navigating via GUI and you can't see '.minecraft' make sure to enable 'show hidden files' in your file manager. Or just paste this)<br>
   mac os: '\~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods'
7. start the game

btw for seeing recipes for everything (almost) i recommend using another mod [Just Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei) by mezz

this stupid mod was made with mcreator 2024.4<br>
just imagine what "amazingness" this mod will have once i understand the forge api thing or whatever it's called<br>
feel free to make your own stupid ahh suggestions and report issues<br>
