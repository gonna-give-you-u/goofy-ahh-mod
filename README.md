# welcome to goofy ahh mod
you need [minecraft forge for 1.20.1](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.20.1.html) please use the 47.4.0 before submitting issues<br>
find this mod on the [releases page](https://github.com/gonna-give-you-u/goofy-ahh-mod/releases)<br><br>

<details><summary>if you dont know how to install mods here's how:<br></summary>
1. install forge (close the launcher first)<br>
2. reopen the launcher (and select the forge profile if it's not already selected)<br>
3. launch the game and let it load i think<br>
4. close the game<br>
5. (optional but recommended) go to the installations tab, click on the forge (not play), expand "MORE OPTIONS", change the 2 in -Xmx2G to the amount of gigabytes of RAM you want to let minecraft use<br>
6. put this mod jar (find it in Releases) into the mods directory (folder)<br>
   winbloat: %appdata%\.minecraft\mods ( C:\Users\your-username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods )<br>
   linux: ~/.minecraft/mods ( /home/your-username/.minecraft/mods) (if navigating via GUI and you can't see '.minecraft' make sure to enable 'show hidden files' in your file manager. Or just paste this)<br>
   mac os: '~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods'<br>
7. start the game
</details>

btw for seeing recipes for everything (almost) i recommend using another mod [Just Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei)

this stupid mod was made with mcreator 2024.4<br>
once i learn the forge api thingy and stuff this mod will become really yes<br>
feel free to make your own stupid ahh suggestions and report issues<br>
